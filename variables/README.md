## Introduction
JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values.

### Declaration
We declare varialbes in javascript using `const` and `let`

const is used to declare `immutable` value while a value declared using let can be `mutated`. const temp = 20; => one cannot cannot assign temp another value eg 30

### Example
In this example we assign convertTemperature an initial value of 0 since the value will change whenever a user key in pereferred unit of temperature.
